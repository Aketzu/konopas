Google Drive Spreadsheet -> KonOpas Javascript converter
========================================================

A tool for using a Google Drive/Docs spreadsheet as a data source for KonOpas. To use, you'll need non-private spreadsheets for programme and people data, each with appropriate labels on the first row. See here for an example, from Finncon 2013:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Auqwt8Hmhr0pdFRiR0hWWWRqRXVUSDVUY2RFYmRzZ0E

To use, modify the `$data array` to point to your data, and, if using, set `$cache_manifest` accordingly (set to FALSE or '' if not using)
