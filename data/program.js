When the village becomes unsafe, it's because the forest has violated the sanctity of civilization, as when the wolf takes the place of Red Riding Hood's grandmother. However, a slew of recent books find their dangerous secrets within the confines of cities: the many neighborhoods in Kathleen Tierney's <I>Blood Oranges<\/I>, the occupied city in N.K. Jemisin's <I>The Shadowed Sun<\/I>, the monster-populated New York in Seanan McGuire's <I>Discount Armageddon<\/I>, the gas-filled walled Seattle of Cherie Priest's Clockwork Century series. What is it about modern life that leads writers and readers to look for discovery and the unknown in cities? How do we cross the border from safety to danger when it's not marked by anything so concrete as the edge of the forest?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<I>Suggested by Josh Jasper.<\/I>"},{"id":238,"title":"Teen Violence, Teen Sex","tags":["Panel"],"day":"2013-07-14","time":"14:00","mins":60,"loc":["G"],"people":[{"id":"368","name":"Steve Berman"},{"id":"519","name":"Gwendolyn Clare"},{"id":"419","name":"Jack M.
