The lovely housecat Mewsette and the accomplished but shy mouser Jaune Tom are in love, but the former is frustrated with his plebeian ways (and those of the farm), to the point of calling him a \"clumsy country clod\". Inspired by the human Jeanette's stories of the glamour and sophistication of Paris (\"Take my Hand, Paree\"), Mewsette runs away by taking a train to the big city, where she encounters the slick con-cat Meowrice (\"The Money Cat\"). Taking advantage of the country kitty's naivete, he puts her in the care of the sultry Madame Henretta Reubens-Chatte, who promises to turn Mewsette into a dainty debutante known as \"The Belle of all Paris\". Unbeknownst to Mewsette, Meowrice is grooming her to be the mail-order bride of a rich American cat in Pittsburgh known as \"Mr. Henry Phtt.\"\n\nGay Purr-ee is an animated film musical produced by United Productions of America and released by Warner Bros. in 1962.

Some of these animals may have belonged to groups that survive today, but others don't seem at all related to animals we know.\n\nThen, between about 570 and 530 million years ago, another burst of diversification occurred, with the eventual appearance of the lineages of almost all animals living today.
