<h1 class="collapse">Loncon 3 Code of Conduct</h1><div>
<p>Loncon 3 exists for the enjoyment and enrichment of the science fiction community. This Code of Conduct seeks to ensure that the behaviour of an individual or group does not disturb other attendees or detract from the relaxed and comfortable atmosphere of the event.
<p>Although we consider our members and attendees to be rational and responsible people, we recognise that issues related to this Code may still arise. We will deal with any issues as promptly, efficiently, and fairly as possible. We thank you for your assistance in making Loncon 3 an enjoyable experience for all attendees.

<h3>Respect for Others</h3>
<p>Loncon 3 should be a place where everyone feels welcome and comfortable. Discrimination or prejudiced behaviour (based on, but not limited to, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, or physical/mental disability) is not tolerated. Harassment of any kind is not tolerated. If someone tells you “no” or asks you to leave them alone, your interaction with them is over.

<h3>Dealing With Harassment</h3>
<p>If you feel that you are being harassed or subjected to prejudiced or unwelcome behaviour, or if you notice someone behaving inappropriately (such as violating hotel or convention policies), we respectfully suggest the following:
<ul>
<li>If you feel comfortable doing so, point out the inappropriate behaviour to the persons involved. Often this will solve the problem immediately.
<li>If you do not feel comfortable talking with the persons involved or if talking to them does not resolve the issue, please report the situation immediately to Operations. Try to provide a name, badge name/number and/or physical description of the persons involved.
</ul>

<h3>Listeners</h3>
<p>Loncon 3 recognises that harassment or unwelcome attention can be deeply unpleasant, and our priority is to provide the maximum support for anyone who has had a negative experience. We therefore have a team of specially selected and briefed convention staff known as “Listeners”. Listeners will:
<ul>
<li>Provide you with a quiet space to talk in private. 
<li>Listen to your concerns.
<li>Explain the options that are available.
<li>Support you in exercising these options.
</ul>
<p>If you want to contact a Listener, please contact Operations and they will find the person on duty.

<h3>Sanctions</h3>
<p>Loncon 3 reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to take such actions as it feels appropriate where any individual or group is found to have breached this Code of Conduct. These actions include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Talking with all parties involved and attempting to mediate a solution.
<li>Issuing verbal warnings.
<li>Revoking memberships and requiring that the person(s) leave the event.
<li>Involving hotel or facility staff or security.
<li>Reporting the matter to local police.
<li>Banning membership of, and attendance at, the remainder of Loncon 3 (including any post-Loncon 3 events).
</ul>
<p>Loncon 3 reserves the right to revoke membership and to eject anyone at any time from the convention without a refund. Loncon 3 also reserves the right to pass details of warnings and expulsions to organisers of future Worldcons for their information and decision-making about future memberships.

<h3>Badges/wristbands</h3>
<p>Loncon 3 is an event open only to people who have attending memberships, day admissions, or other passes issued by the convention. All attendees must wear their badge/wristband while in convention space, in such a way that it is clearly visible. The person to whom a badge/wristband was issued is responsible for its use. If a badge is lost, there will be a £30 charge for a replacement.
<p>children aged 6 or older must have a purchased membership or day admission for the convention, while children aged 5 and under must be registered as Infants. All children under 12 should be accompanied by an adult.

<h3>Financial Transactions</h3>
<p>Anyone who owes an outstanding balance to Loncon 3 (e.g. outstanding payment on a membership instalment plan or dealer table rental) must settle that balance before being permitted to attend the convention.

<h3>General Rating of the Convention</h3>
<p>All convention areas are open to members of all ages with the exception of events, exhibits, or items that are specifically noted to be inappropriate for minors and to which access is controlled.

<h3>Privacy, Photographs & Electronic Recordings</h3>
<p>Please be aware that photography, video, and audio recordings are frequently made by Loncon 3 during proceedings. The likenesses of convention attendees and members might appear in those recordings. Attendees and members agree to assign without compensation the use of their likeness in promotional material.

<h3>Personal Photography/Recordings</h3>
<p>Please be polite and ask before taking photographs or recordings of members and attendees whenever possible. Video and audio recording and photography for personal archival use only is generally acceptable unless individuals make it clear that they do not wish to be photographed or recorded, either by wearing a “no photography” badge or by any other means. In that case, any photography or recording of them is expressly forbidden. Anyone who persists in filming/recording/photographing Loncon 3 members who have denied their consent will be expelled from the convention.

<h3>Social Media</h3>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies equally to use of social media such as (but not limited to) Facebook and Twitter. Online harassment of, or prejudiced conduct towards, another member of the convention will be treated in the same way as face-to-face misconduct.

<h3>Media Relations</h3>
<p>Members of the press are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct and also by our Press Policy.

<h3>Sales of Merchandise</h3>
<p>The offering for sale of any merchandise at the convention may be undertaken only in designated spaces with permission from the convention.

<h3>Smoking</h3>
<p>Smoking is not allowed in any public buildings, including restaurants and bars. Smoking, including electronic cigarettes, is not permitted anywhere in the ExCeL building.

<h3>ExCeL</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pets: With the exception of assistance dogs, pets are not allowed in ExCeL.
<li>Alcohol: The bar in the Capital Hall (Loncon 3 Fan Village) serves alcohol. You can bring drinks in plastic glasses out of the Capital Hall but you cannot take them into the Exhibits Hall (which contains the Dealers’ Zone, Art Show, and Displays). The legal drinking age in the UK is 18.
<li>Signs: Signs can be put up in the convention space but not in the public areas of ExCeL.
</ul>

<h3>Weapons</h3>
<p>No actual weapon, or any item that can be mistaken for one, may be carried either openly or concealed at any time on properties being used for Loncon 3, with the following exceptions:
<ul>
<li>If you want to carry a weapon or are unsure whether your weapon might be considered realistic, you must present it to Operations. They are the final arbiter of whether the item may be carried and whether it requires peace-bonding.
<li>Any actual weapon, or any item that can be mistaken for one, that you have purchased in the Dealers’ Zone must be wrapped and immediately transported to your accommodation or vehicle. If you want to carry the item at the convention, please refer to the previous point.
<li>If an actual weapon, or any item that can be mistaken for one, is part of your Masquerade costume, you must transport it to and from the Masquerade Green Room wrapped securely unless the item is peace-bonded. The Masquerade director must approve your use of any weapons during the Masquerade.
<li>Live steel is prohibited under all circumstances. Operations are the final arbiter of what constitutes live steel. 
<li>Any weapon, whether actual, realistic, or toy/prop, that is used in a threatening or harmful manner may result in confiscation of the item and/or removal of your membership or pass without refund.
<li>The only allowable variation to this policy will be for any convention scheduled programme demonstrations and sanctioned activities, in designated areas at specific times, that have been risk assessed.
</ul>
<p>Failure to adhere to any of the above policies is grounds for the removal of your membership or pass without refund.

<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>Loncon 3 reserves the right to amend these rules at any time without prior or posted notice and reserves the sole right of interpretation.
<p>Please keep in mind that these rules involve, of course, worst-case scenarios and are put in place to ensure the safety and comfort of our members. They are not all-inclusive; in all cases, the singular rule that supersedes all others is:
<p>Any action or behaviour that:
<ul>
<li>is illegal, or
<li>causes significant interference with convention operations or excessive discomfort to other attendees, or
<li>adversely affects Loncon 3’s relationship with its guests, its venue, or the public
</ul>
is strictly forbidden and may result in revocation of membership and/or attendance privileges.</p>

<h2 class="collapse">Inside The Convention</h2><div>
<h3>Where To Get Help</h3>
<p>Ops, short for Operations, is the place where we solve problems. Our main base is in the Fan Village, in a yurt labelled Ops, but our people are also out and about in red Hi-Vis jackets. 
<p>We can help you with all sorts of things, including lost children, lost and found property, security problems such as theft or fighting, harassment or unwelcome photography, and malfunctioning equipment. We can solve some problems on the spot, but for others we might put you in touch with the Loncon 3 department responsible or with ExCeL’s security teams. If you need help accessing a specific department or talking to ExCeL’s security team then we’ll provide it. 
<p>We work closely with ExCeL’s security team, who are responsible for lost children, first aid, security, and lost and found. You can always approach them directly with any problem. They’ll refer you back to Ops if your request is outside their remit, just as Ops will put you in contact with them when appropriate and support you while you’re working with them. 
<p>In particular if you are subjected to any form of harassment, we will provide you with a safe space and access to our team of Listeners. 
<p>So, if you need help, look for the Ops Yurt in the Fan Village. Our opening times are the same as the Fan Village, from 9am all the way through to close after 2am.

<h3>Volunteers</h3>
<p>From Thursday morning, the Volunteer Desk will be located in the Staff Lounge, which is in the Fan Village (aka Capital Hall). On Wednesday, the Volunteer Desk will be close to Registration, on the Boulevard Level 0.
<p>If you want to volunteer to help out at the convention, please come to the Staff Lounge! The Worldcon is run entirely by volunteers, and we cannot do this immense job without you. 
<p>Volunteers have access to the Staff Lounge in the Fan Village, a space to relax, sit down and have a drink. Because British Worldcons cannot provide food and beverages in the staff lounge, our practice is to provide volunteers with tokens, known as “groats”, that can be exchanged for food and drink. You will be eligible for a groat for each hour worked for the convention, and you can use them to buy food and drinks in the Fan Village and products from some sellers in the Dealers’ Zone.
<p>Volunteers who have worked for 15 hours or more will also get a free, limited edition T-shirt as a thank you from the convention.

<h3>Getting Started: Registration, Access, Info Desk, and more</h3>
<p>On the Boulevard Level 0, right by the east entrance of ExCeL and at ground level, you’ll find a number of useful areas including Registration, Access, Information Desk, and the Hotel Help Desk. 
<p>On arrival, please go to Registration and collect your badge, which gives you access to the convention. 
<p>If you need Access assistance at the convention, please speak to the team at the Access Desk. If you haven’t already registered, they can help you to do so if you wish, and they will provide you with an Access ribbon, which lets Loncon 3 staff and volunteers know that you might need extra assistance and (if required) entitles you to priority seating in programme items and events, and priority access to lifts. This is also where you can collect your reserved mobility scooter or wheelchair or (subject to availability) arrange to rent one if you haven’t made a reservation. The team can also help with other Access requests, such as large-print publications or earplugs. Please note that the Access Desk might be moved to Registration if there are queues waiting to enter the Auditorium. 
<p>The Hotel Help Desk can help sort out hotel booking problems. The Information Desk is the place to go for general queries and getting information about the location of childcare, requesting a No Photography badge, and signing up for a free one-year subscription to <i>Amazing Stories</i> magazine.
<p>Make sure that you <b>always</b> wear your badge, and be careful not to lose it: ExCeL security will not let you into convention areas without it. Badges remain the property of the convention and may be withdrawn at any time, without a refund, for unruly or unacceptable behaviour: please see the <b><i>Code of Conduct</i></b>. Lost badges will be replaced for a fee of £30, which may be refunded if the lost badge is found and returned to you or us before the end of the convention. If you forget your badge, a temporary badge will be issued to you for a fee, which can be refunded if the temporary badge is returned to Registration within 24 hours.

<h3>Programme Participant Check-In</h3>
<p>After registering for the convention, programme participants can pick up their programme packets at Programme Participant Check-in, located next by Registration, on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. After Friday, pick up your packets at Programme Ops in the Capital Lounge.

<h3>Access to Boulevard on Friday and Saturday</h3>
<p>There will be a large music event at the other (west) end of ExCeL on Friday evening and Saturday afternoon and evening.
<p>We do not expect this to cause problems as it’s a very large building, but Loncon 3 members should be aware that the Boulevard Level 1 through ExCeL will be closed to through traffic during the event. Therefore, those coming from the far end of ExCeL will need to walk outside along the waterfront instead of using the Boulevard. If coming to the convention by train, make sure to use Prince Regent station rather than Custom House.

<h3>Childcare</h3>
<p>Our childcare for Loncon 3 is being provided by local company Eden Mobile Crèche. The facility is located within ExCeL, about 5-10 minutes walk from the Boulevard. If you have a childcare booking, please visit the Information Desk for more details. 
<p>Please note that meals are not provided and you are expected to make food arrangements for your child. Eden is happy to give your child any food you provide that does not require refrigeration. 

<h3>Food and Drink</h3>
<p>There are a number of food outlets along the Boulevard Level 1, and you can also buy food and drinks in the Fan Village. Lots of restaurants are close to ExCeL – for more information, refer to the restaurant guide in the back of this pocket programme.
<p>Please clean up after yourself, using the bins provided.
<p>You cannot bring alcohol into ExCeL but you can buy a drink in the Fan Village or from one of the ExCeL bars. The legal drinking age in the UK is 18. If you look as though you are under 25, you might be asked to provide proof of age. 
<p>Please note that no food or drink may be taken into the Exhibits Hall. 

<h3>Mobile Phone Charging Station</h3>
<p>In case you run out of juice for your mobile phone - which usually happens when your charger is in the hotel room - a mobile phone charging station is in the Library in the Fan Village. This station can be used by members of the convention and is sponsored by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/many.jofs/">Journeymen of Fandom</a>.

<h3>Smoking</h3>
<p>English law prohibits smoking in any building that’s not a private home, with the exception of hotel bedrooms designated as smoking rooms. ExCeL’s own smoking policy also prohibits the use of electronic cigarettes anywhere in the ExCeL building.

<h3>Social Media and Newsletter</h3>
<p>You can find us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/loncon3">@Loncon3</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/loncon3">#Loncon3</a>. We’re also on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/londonin2014">Facebook</a>. You can email <i>The Pigeon Post</i>, the Loncon 3 newsletter, on <a href="mailto:newsletter@loncon3.org">newsletter@loncon3.org</a>, or check the first issue for the location of our contribution boxes.

<h3>WiFi</h3>
<p>An SF fan’s favorite two syllables! ExCel offers free wireless Internet to all visitors. There are two networks, at different frequencies. <i>ExCeL free</i> operates at 2.4 Mhz, and should be visible to all devices. <i>ExCeL free fast</i> is a newer 5 MHz network, which older devices might not be able to connect to. If you can connect to the faster network, please do: it has more capacity and is less likely to become overloaded. 
<p>The convention should have enough bandwidth for email, social media, photo uploads, and so on. Please avoid streaming music or video; remember, you’re sharing the bandwidth with all other Loncon 3 attendees.

</div>

<h2 class="collapse">Outside the Convention</h2><div>
<h3>Emergency Services</h3>
<p>If an emergency occurs, please stay calm. Tell a member of ExCeL staff that there is a problem, or ask someone else to do so. If none are available, call 4444 on the internal phones located at the entrance to each hall. If you cannot access an internal phone, in an emergency, call 999.
<p>ExCeL is a large and complicated site. The ExCeL staff have their own response teams for emergencies, and they have close relationships with the local emergency services. They will be able to provide an emergency response to the exact location.

<h3>Business Services Centre</h3>
<p>ExCeL has a Business Services Centre open during the day seven days a week, offering services like photocopying and couriers, and selling a range of stationery, tools, cables, and so on. It’s located on Level 0, downstairs from the Boulevard Level 1 by doors N4/S4, near the west end of the building. It will not be accessible to Loncon 3 members on Saturday afternoon due to another event in the building. 

<h3>Cash Machines (ATMs)</h3>
<p>There are a number of cash machines (ATMs) close to or inside ExCeL. On the Boulevard Level 1, there are four HSBC, one Barclays, and one Travelex cash machines. There are also Travelex cash machines in the Aloft, Ramada and Custom House hotels, and a cash machine in the Tesco Express to the west of ExCeL. None of these machines charges for cash withdrawals. There is a Notemachine cash machine in the Premier Inn, which charges £1.75 per withdrawal.
<p>Non-UK account holders will probably be charged by their own bank in addition to any charge from the cash machine.

<h3>Pharmacy</h3>
<p>The closest pharmacy is located on Freemasons Road, opposite Custom House DLR station, approximately a 5-minute walk from the west entrance of ExCeL. Some non-prescription medicines (aspirins and such) are available from the Tesco Express next to the Crowne Plaza hotel (also approximately a 5-minute walk from the west entrance).

<h3>Post Office</h3>
<p>The closest Post Office to ExCeL is at 272-283 Victoria Dock Road, just minute’s walk from Custom House Station. It is closed on Sunday, but open from 9am to 5.30pm on weekdays and 9am to 12.30pm on Saturdays.

<h3>Medical Centres</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.thepracticeplc.com/surgeries/the-practice-britannia-village">The Practice</a>, a National Health Service walk-in centre, is located on the other side of the dock from ExCeL in Britannia Village, 12a Wesley Avenue, London, E16 1TU, tel 020 3040 0100. Closed Saturdays and Sundays. 
<p><a href="http://www.barkantine.nhs.uk">The Barkantine Walk-In Centre</a>, open from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week, is a little further away at 121 Westferry Road, Isle of Dogs, London, E14 8JH, tel 020 7791 8080.
<p>Note that emergency medical treatment at a hospital or at this type of centre is free of charge in England and Wales. If you have a European Health Insurance Card, non-emergency treatment will generally also be covered.

<h3>Supermarkets</h3>
<p>A Whistlestop convenience store is on the Boulevard Level 1 near the west end of the building (the far end from Loncon 3). There are Londis and Tesco Express supermarkets on Western Gateway, the road running west from ExCeL past the Novotel and Crowne Plaza hotels.

</div>

<h1 class="collapse">Exhibits Hall</h1><div>
<p>The Exhibits Hall is on the north side of the Boulevard, on Level 1, and is accessed through door N11 or via the staircase from the Fan Village.
<p>The Exhibits Hall includes dealers, displays, and the Art Show, as well as most signings, and the Masquerade Desk. It will also host some programming, including art, Exhibits (Displays), and costuming items.
<p><i>No food and no open drinks are permitted in the Exhibits Hall</i> except for small snacks for dealers and for people manning displays.
<p>The Exhibits Hall banners feature artwork by Chris Foss, and the Dealers’ Zone banners are by Kelly Smith. Most of the pigeons that you see around the Exhibits Hall were designed by Serena Culfeather.

<h2>Art Show</h2>
<p>The Loncon 3 Art Show features over 2,000 pieces of artwork, the majority available for purchase and with prices ranging from just a few pounds to many thousands. The Art Show is complemented by a varied art programme including talks, panels, and demonstrations, as well as the presentation of the Chesley Awards by the Association of Science Fiction and Fantasy Artists, which recognise individual artistic works and achievements in science fiction and fantasy.
<p>Please note that photography is not permitted in the Art Show.

<h3>Artist Showcase</h3>
<p>If you have pre-ordered a copy of the printed Artist Showcase, please come to the Art Show control desk on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday to collect it.

<h3>Art Show Buyer’s Guide</h3>
<p>The Art Show at Loncon 3 comprises the main Art Show, where works are sold to the highest bidder, and the Print Shop, where prints are available for immediate purchase at a fixed price. To buy from either display, you first need to register as a bidder at the control desk just inside the Art Show entrance and be assigned a bidder number. To buy a print, just make a note of the item you are interested in (artist and title) and then go to the control desk to make your purchase. 
<p>For the main show, each for-sale item has a bid sheet next to it, where bidders enter their offers and bidder numbers. A minimum reserve price is listed, and you must bid more than any previous bidder. The bid sheets have room for six bids. If the sheet is full (i.e. there are six bids) when the show closes at noon on Sunday, the item will go to the Art Auction. If there are fewer than six bids, then the item will go automatically to the highest listed bidder.
<p>A special “Buy It Now” option is also available for some items. This option will be available on Friday and Saturday only, and enables you to buy an Art Show item instantly for a stated “retail” price as long as no one else has bid on the item. This option is particularly intended to help Day Members who will not be able to come back on Sunday.

<h3>Art Auction</h3>
<p>The Art Auction will start at 2pm on Sunday. This voice auction will be used to sell the most popular items - those with a full bid sheet. The auction moves quickly so if you want to attend, arrive in good time and watch out for any item you’re interested in! You will also need a bidder paddle with your bidder number on it - you can collect these from the control desk after noon on Sunday. You can of course bid on any item in the auction, whether or not you bid for it originally.

<h3>Art Show Pick-Up - Important Information</h3>
<p>The Art Show will re-open for payment and collection of purchased art from 4pm to 6pm on Sunday and 10am to 2pm on Monday. All art must be collected by 2pm Monday.
<p>Unsold works still on display may be purchased during this period at the “Buy It Now” price.

<h3>Demonstrations and Artists in Residence</h3>
<p>An extensive series of demonstrations is scheduled between Thursday afternoon and Sunday morning. These include artists working in acrylics, watercolour, airbrushing, oils, and pastel. We also have sessions where members can try their hand alongside our professional artists. These sessions include open life drawing sessions on Friday and Saturday afternoon as well as clay modelling, bead embroidery, and gold leafing. All materials are provided by the convention.
<p>Alongside our demonstrations, we also have Artists in Residence (AIR) tables located just inside the Art Show entrance. You’ll find artists here throughout the convention - sitting, talking, working, and selling merchandise.
<p>This pocket programme provides the demonstration and AIR schedules and they are also in an Art Show guide that you can collect from the control desk.

<h3>Docent Tours</h3>

<h2>Displays</h2>
<p>Loncon 3’s Exhibits Hall is one of the most diverse ever seen at a Worldcon. We have over 80 displays covering themes such as art, science, space exploration, history, politics, conventions, and costuming, and of course displays celebrating each of our Guests of Honour. Old favourites, such as the Hugo Awards, will be there, as well as new displays never before seen at a Worldcon – things like Darwin’s Pigeons, A Mission To Mars, science fiction and political cartooning, the Institute For Interstellar Studies, Kids’ Company, and the Petrie Museum of Egyptology. Anglia Ruskin University is sponsoring an academic poster session that will present the cutting edge of British academic research. 
<p>Please come along to the Exhibits Hall to pick up a copy of the full Displays Catalogue, and check out the Exhibits (Displays) programme track, which explores a handful of the Exhibits Hall displays in greater detail. There are talks organised by exhibitors, interviews, and guided tours of the displays, many of which encourage audience interaction. Everything from the history of fandom, costuming, art, movies, literature, and science is represented. This track is about encouraging attendees of Loncon 3 to not only peruse the Exhibits Hall but also to take the time to learn more about the exhibits and ask the exhibitors questions. Who knows, you might just find out some fun facts that you would not have learned otherwise!
<p>We also have an <a href="http://loncon3.org/displays_guide.php">MP3 audio guide</a> available for the displays.

<h2>Flexible Space</h2>
<p>The Flexible Space is an open area on the west side of the Exhibits Hall that will be reconfigured each day to accommodate different programme items, from larger art demos and Darwin’s Pigeons, for which audience members will primarily be standing around the item to observe it, to the Art Auction with seating for 320.
<p>On Monday from noon-2pm, the Flexible Space will host the End-of-Convention Fire Sale. If you, or a convention that you’re involved with, could use a mannequin, a mirror, or a decorative banner then remember that these are the sorts of things that we are selling off during the convention, for collection on Monday. They’re the odds and ends that were easier to buy than to rent, and they’ll all need a good home.
<p>The catalogue of fire-sale goods is available on the convention website, and you can purchase goods for Monday collection through Operations, based in the Ops Yurt in the Fan Village. Then, from noon to 2pm on Monday, come to the Exhibits Hall flexible space for a final chance to buy the remaining treasures (or at least, goods) and pick up a pigeon.

</div>


<h1 class="collapse">Fan Village</h1><div>
<h2>Welcome To the Village</h2>
<p>The Fan Village is in the Capital Hall, on the north side of Level 0 of the Boulevard. You can also access it via the staircase from the Exhibits Hall.
<p>We intend the Fan Village to be the heart of the convention, and we hope you’ll find it a great space to meet up with your friends, hang out, take a breather from the excitement elsewhere, and perhaps discover something unexpected. Loncon is a British convention, and the heart of British conventions is the bar. The Fan Village will be our bar and cafe, and so much else besides.
<p>Every part of the village has different things going on. It hosts our gaming space, where there will be lots of organised games going on as well as plenty of space for you to play your own games.
<p>Our Fan Activity Tent hosts a whole range of less-structured programming, and is the home for some of our lively programme for families to enjoy together. Families may also wish to help us build our TARDIS, which, when finished, should provide extra amenities such as unlimited space, time travel, and a genuine Finnish Sauna.
<p>No village is complete without a bandstand, and ours has been handmade for us. It will host acoustic performances, comedy and pop-up readings. 
<p>The Library is a quieter space for some pop-up readings and publishers’ parties, and features books, fanzines, and other stuff to read and take away.
<p>The Fan Village also hosts the Fan Tables, run by various organisations, and the bar and café, and, of course, the parties! 
<p>Operations is also be based here, to keep make sure that everything runs smoothly, and the Staff Lounge and Volunteers Desk, who’ll be delighted to see you if you’d like to help out with the convention. 

<!-- [MAP] -->

<h2>Parties</h2>
<p>Remember that the Fan Village is the place where the parties happen at Loncon 3. All our major parties are here; we aren’t using any hotel space for parties. We have tried to create a festival feel, with marquees arranged around our central lawn and party tree. We’re thrilled that so many conventions, publishers, and fan groups want to help you all have fun by throwing a party at Loncon 3. A full list of all the Fan Village parties will appear in <i>The Pigeon Post</i>, the Loncon 3 newsletter, or you can check at the party tree for a list of all of all the next day’s parties. We’re open till the small hours, though if you’re travelling to Loncon 3 daily or just for one day then please make sure you know how you’re getting home before you start partying! The bar and cafe are also open late.

<h2>Hall Costumes</h2>
<p>We really hope there will be lots of people around the convention in costume. If you need any help putting the finishing touches to your costume, or feel inspired to make one from scratch, head along to Chaos Costuming in the Exhibits Hall. If you need a place to change, or just want to relax and be out of character for a little while, head along to the Costume Recovery area in the Fan Village. 
<p>On Sunday, we are arranging a special session where costumers, photographers, and artists can come together. The Flexible Space in the Exhibits Hall will be set up with lighting and a backdrop so that costumers can pose for photographs and sketches
<p>Outside this special session, please remember to ask before taking photos, regardless of whether someone is in costume.

<h2>Teen Lounge</h2>
<p>If you’re a teenager, there’s a special area of the Fan Village just for you. Come to the teen lounge to chill, chat, or just get away from the old folks for a while. Teens only!

<h2>Gaming</h2>
<p>The Games Tent is located at the back of the Fan Village, next to the Library. We have a large games library being supplied by Eclectic Games, and you can also bring your own games to play during the con, with a check-in system so that they can be identified as yours.
<p>Whiteboards will show what gamesklatsches and events are happening each day. We also have lots of demo teams running playtesting, board and card games, roleplaying games, and a few surprises throughout the convention. As well as tables for you to play games on, we have comfy seating for people who want to streetpass or play handheld games together.
<p>Talk to the Games Tent volunteers if you want to run your own gamesklatsche during the convention and we will try to allocate you a slot.
<p>Please be respectful of everyone in the tent and their games. Treat anything you borrow as if were your own.

<h3>Game Times</h3>
<p>The Games Tent is open from 10am every day until late at night, other than on Thursday and Saturday evenings, when we will be running LARP events (set up 7:30pm, start 8pm). While the tent is being used for LARPs, you will still be able to play board and card games outside in the Fan Village. 
<p>On Friday, a session of Azad will run from 7pm. This might make things a little crowded, but the tent will also still be open for other games.
<p>We have several sets of Werewolf, and have set aside Sunday night especially for this game. Again, the tent will also be open all evening for general play.

<h2>Fan Activity Tent</h2>
<p>The Fan Activity Tent is the site for a range of fun events for fans, including children’s activities, quizzes, workshops, fan meetups, and more. 
<p>The mornings are mainly about the kids, allowing them to “Steampunk” various articles, and build with Lego and Scalextric. Later in the day, when the over-18’s have woken up, we focus on them, with items including Pictionary, a Babylon 5 meet-up, a Book Club for all the fans of authors who aren’t elsewhere at the con, and the Fan Funds Casino on Saturday night. Check the schedules later in this programme, or just turn up and see what’s going on.

<h3>Dances</h3>
<p>In the tradition of many Worldcons, we have many opportunities for our attendees to get their groove on during the convention. From traditional Regency Dance to 30s style swing all the way to the 80s and now, there’s something for everyone!

</div>


<h1 class="collapse">Programme</h1><div>
<p>Last but not least, the programme! With 600 programme items featuring some 900 participants, our programme offers something (and probably many somethings) for everybody. So that everybody can have a good experience, we ask that you be considerate and remember the following guidelines.
<p>Most programme items are in either the London Suite, next door to the Fan Village on Level 0 of the Boulevard, or the Capital Suite, on Level 3 which can be accessed up the escalators from the Boulevard.
<p>During programme items, do not block the aisles or the doors, and if you arrive late to an item, please enter quietly. Please leave seats marked Reserved available until 5 minutes into the panel for those who have access needs. Many programme items welcome audience questions, and moderators will tell you whether they plan to take questions from the beginning of the item or later in the item. 
<p>Please do not record programme items. Prior arrangements through Programme have been made to allow the recording of only a handful of items. There will be an announcement at the beginning of these items regarding the fact that they are being recorded. 
<p>Please do not take photographs without permission, as mentioned in our Code of Conduct. If you want to take a photograph, please check with the moderator before the item begins. If you cannot or have not done so, then please refrain from photography. Please also do not record or take photographs in any location with No Photography signs posted. Your camera or recording device is subject to confiscation if you violate this policy. 
<p>When using the free WiFi, please be aware that the bandwidth is limited and avoid streaming such as webcasting. This will make the network more usable for everyone.
<p>In order for items to start on time, the previous item must end on time. Items will start at the time advertised and end 10-15 minutes before the start time of the next item. When an item ends, please do not ask for autographs or have discussions with the panelists in the programme room because we need to prepare for the next item. Instead, look for panelists in the hallways after the session, or attend a signing session or kaffeeklatsch if they have one. 

<h3>Electronic Programme Guides</h3>
<p>Loncon 3 is providing up-to-date online access to the programme schedule through mobile apps. You can create your own schedule, receive up-to-date information about the programme and notifications of changes, view maps of the convention facilities, and access pages of other useful information about the convention. 
<p>We are using the mobile-friendly web-based guide <a href="http://konopas.org/">KonOpas</a> (which you’re currently looking at) as well as the native mobile Grenadine Event Guide, available on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/grenadine-event-guide/id886788146?mt=8">iTunes</a> for iOS 7.1 and later, and on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grenadine.confee">Google Play</a> for Android 2.3 and later. The identifier to download the schedule is <b>LONCON</b>.
<p>A <a href="http://loncon3.org/documents/ReadMe_LR.pdf">PDF version</a> of the Pocket Programme is also available.

<h3>Costuming, Cosplay, and Style</h3>
<p>Costume has been a part of Worldcon since Forrey Ackerman and Myrtle Douglas arrived in New York in 1939 wearing their <i>futuricostumes</i>. The Costume, Cosplay, and Style area of the Loncon 3 programme includes a healthy mixture of how-to panels, demos, and hands-on workshops on designing, making, and wearing costumes, as well as exploration of costume and visions of future fashion in art, history, and literature. Whether you yourself like to costume, or explore its new manifestation as cosplay, or just appreciate it as another aspect of SFF, we have something for you!

<h3>Filk</h3>
<p>“Filk” music is a musical movement among fans of science fiction and fantasy, emphasising content which is related to the genre or its fans, and promoting broad participation. We have a diverse and entertaining filk stream planned for you, with concerts showcasing the musical talents of fans from around the world. Come along to hear smooth jazz, blood-pumping rock, beautiful choral arrangements, and everything in between. Highlights include <i>Before the Dawn</i>, a filk musical (Monday 4.30pm), and a concert from Seanan McGuire, aka Mira Grant, (Saturday 10pm). 
<p>If you don’t have a concert scheduled but still want to perform, please sign up in Capital Suite 1 from 3pm on Thursday for a space in a one-shot concert. We have two hours of open concert time, as well as the Paper Worlds concert for songs inspired by books (accompanied by a short reading from the book that inspired them), and everyone is welcome. 
<p>Everyone is welcome at the open filk circles each evening, whether performer or listener: we look forward to seeing you there!

<h3>Kaffeeklatsches and Literary Beers</h3>
<p>Kaffeeklatsches and Literary Beers are small group discussions with authors, artists, editors, and other interesting personalities. Kaffeeklatsches are located in the London Suite, and Literary Beers in the bar area of the Fan Village. Sessions are limited to 9 attendees, and advance signup is required. Overbooking is not allowed. Sign-up sheets will be available at the Information Desk the day before each session. Morning slots (those starting 10am-1pm) will be available from 9:30am on the morning before, and afternoon slots (from 2pm onwards) will be available at 2pm the afternoon before. Each person in line may sign up for only one kaffeeklatsch per session, and only one person per kaffeeklatsch (although you may sign up for someone other than yourself). You must provide the attendee’s badge name and number to sign up. Three reserve places will be available in case an attendee cancels a booking or does not show up.
<p>Unfortunately we can provide drinks only for session hosts, so please feel free to bring your own drink with you.

<h3>Music </h3>
<p>The music programme at Loncon 3 covers all aspects of music related to science fiction and fantasy, through participatory, practical, and panel-based sessions. This track is complementary to the filk programme. The format will be a mix of panels, hands-on sessions, live performance, and possibly pre-recorded TV, film, and radio music. 
<p>Our goal is to highlight science fiction and fantasy music in the widest sense. We hope that attendees will have fun, learn something new, and participate. On <b>Friday at 8pm in the ICC Auditorium</b>, the Worldcon Philharmonic Orchestra will perform works related to science fiction and fantasy, exploring the history of the connection between music and the genre and including pieces that explore what makes “the sound of the future”.
<p>Featuring some of the UK’s finest musicians and soloists, including soprano Sarah Fox and members of the London Symphony, Royal Philharmonic, and London Philharmonic orchestras, the Worldcon orchestra will be led by Keith Slade (National Schools Symphony Orchestra and the Worcester Symphony Orchestra). Highlights include music from Holst’s <i>The Planets</i>, Dvorak’s <i>Song to the Moon</i>, Stravinsky’s <i>Firebird Suite</i>, Shimomura’s <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> soundtrack, and John Williams’ <i>Star Wars Suite</i>, as well as a special memorial piece for Iain M Banks. The programme has been arranged by Adam Robinson, and the event will be hosted by Vincent Docherty.

<h3>Science</h3>
<p>The science track combines talks by professional scientists including Lord Rees, the Astronomer Royal, and Alan Bond, the inventor of the engines for Skylon; discussion of scientific and real-world issues between professionals, writers, and fans; and some fun! We have subject matter ranging from cosmology to genetics, medicine to modern warfare, as well as two special tracks from the British Interplanetary Society and the Initiative for Interstellar Studies. 
<p>Come to the science track to find out about the science inspiring the next generation of science fiction writers, and to meet scientists turning our science fiction dreams into reality! 

<h3>Signings</h3>
<p>In order to make signings run smoothly, please limit yourself to three items per signing. In certain cases, the Signings staff might have to lower the number of books per pass. Once you’ve had three books signed, you may go to the end of the line for more as long as there is time for repeat autographs. 
<p>If you have a complex dedication, use the Post-It notes provided to write the dedication and present it to the author with your book. 
<p>Please be courteous if there is a line — give other fans a chance to get their books autographed. In order to avoid having people wait in line without a chance of reaching the front before the end of the session, the Signings staff might need to close the line before the session is over. 

<h3>Stroll With The Stars</h3>
<p>Join some of your favourite authors, artists, and editors for a nice morning stroll. (And we stress “stroll” - defined as a leisurely walk. This will not be a heart-pounding aerobic activity; it will be a stroll.) Join us for some fresh air, a healthy stroll, and some good conversation. This walk will be a leisurely mile - which will take a little more than a half-hour but less than an hour. Strolls will leave at 9am from the front of the Aloft Hotel, and will return by 10am, rain or shine.

<h3>Business Meeting </h3>
<p>Every member of Worldcon can participate in the rule-making process at the Business Meeting, which is like a big “town meeting” that determines the rules for things like the Hugo Award categories and how Worldcon sites are selected.
<p>The World Science Fiction Society (WSFS) consists of every member of the current Worldcon. WSFS rules, published in the Souvenir Book, consist of a Constitution containing the rules for the Hugo Awards and for the selection of future Worldcons, as well as Standing Rules for how the Business Meeting is conducted. 
<p>The Business Meeting is held on the second, third, and fourth mornings of the Worldcon (rarely, a meeting on the fifth day is required). Every member of WSFS can attend the meeting, propose changes, debate those changes, and vote on them. For Loncon 3, the business meetings will be held on Friday to Monday, from 10am to 1pm.
<p>Check the newsletter for any updates about the Business Meeting throughout the convention.

<h3>Site Selection </h3>
<p>You can vote for where your Worldcon will be held in 2016 at the site selection tables in the Fan Village, open from 10am to 6pm on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. The two sites that are bidding are Beijing, China, and Kansas City, Missouri (US).
<p>To vote in site selection you submit a written ballot, on a one member, one vote basis. To be eligible to vote, you must be a living, natural person and an Attending, Young Adult, or Supporting Member of Loncon 3. (Please note that holders of child memberships, single day admissions, and hall passes are <i>not</i> eligible to vote in site selection.) 
<p>The cost to vote is $40 and your vote will automatically convert to a Supporting membership of the winning bid regardless of who you vote for.
